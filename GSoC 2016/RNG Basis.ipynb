    "\n",
    "- Using power-of-two period makes it trival to have a uniform power-of-two output range.\n",
    "- A non-power-of-two output range or period can add challenges. For example, MRG32k3a has an output modulus of $2^32-209$, making it ill-suited for generating 32-bit integers. However such issues need not be a fatal flaw.\n",

    "#### The Necessity of a “Large Enough” State Space and Period\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's undesirable to have a generator repeat itself while in use.\n",
    "- Even a period as \"small\" as $2^56$ would take a single CPU core more than two years to iterate through at one number per nanosecond.\n",
    "- Long periods are sometimes advocated to support multiple random-number streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The importance of Code Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code size can influence cache usage and opportunities for function inlining.\n",
    "- The longer the code, the more likely it is to contain implementation errors, which are very challenging because they can be subtle\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Summary of Size Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is preferable to use as little additional space as possible, both for data and for code."
