    "- Using power-of-two period makes it trival to have a uniform power-of-two output range.\n",
    "- A non-power-of-two output range or period can add challenges. For example, MRG32k3a has an output modulus of $2^32-209$, making it ill-suited for generating 32-bit integers. However such issues need not be a fatal flaw.\n",

    "- It's undesirable to have a generator repeat itself while in use.\n",
